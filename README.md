## Hey, I'm Jawuan!

I recently graduated from Arizona State University with a bachelor's degree in computer science, and will be completing my master's next year. I've explored many aspects of professional software development through various school, internship, and personal projects. I look forward to sharing some of my work on this profile and developing more creative technical projects moving forward!
